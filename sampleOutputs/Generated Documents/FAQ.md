## What is the recommended iterative development approach for cost-effective applications?

For many applications, an iterative approach is recommended:
- Start with faster, cost-effective models like **Claude Haiku** to lower initial costs.
- Upgrade only when specific capability gaps arise, ensuring cost efficiency.

## Which Claude models are recommended for complex tasks requiring advanced intelligence?

For complex tasks requiring advanced intelligence:
- Initially deploy highly capable models such as **Claude Sonnet** or **Claude Opus**.
- Follow this with efficiency optimization once core capabilities are established.
