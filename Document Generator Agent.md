## The Problem We're Solving

In today's knowledge economy, organizations face a critical challenge: **content is everywhere, but it's rarely in the right format**. Teams deal with:

- 📄 **Scattered knowledge**: PDFs, slide decks, markdown files, web articles, Word documents
- 🔄 **Manual conversion**: Hours spent reformatting content for different audiences
- 🎨 **Inconsistent presentation**: No unified visual language across documents
- 📊 **Lost context**: Important information buried in poorly structured files
- ⏰ **Time waste**: Developers and content creators spending 20-30% of their time on document formatting
